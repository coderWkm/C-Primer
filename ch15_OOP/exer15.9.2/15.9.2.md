以拷贝为例：

只有一个私有成员：`shared_ptr<Query_base> q`，首先会调用该shared_ptr的拷贝构造函数/拷贝赋值运算符。而后拷贝构造函数/拷贝赋值运算符会调用Query_base的拷贝构造函数/拷贝赋值运算符，二者在Query_base均是默认的。根据Query_base的继承关系和q的动态绑定的实际类型，会执行
Query_base的某种派生类的拷贝构造函数/拷贝赋值运算符。

> - copy: While being copied, the synthesized copy constructor is called. It copies the data member into the new object. Since in this case, the data member is a shared pointer, while copying, the corresponding shared pointer points to the same address and <u>the use count from the both shared pointer becomes 2</u>.
> - move: while being moved, the synthesized move constructor is called. It moves the data member into the new object. In this case, the shared pointer from the newly created object will point to the address to which <u>the original shared pointer pointed. After the move operation, the use count of the shared pointer in the new object is 1</u>, whereas the pointer from the original object becomes nullptr.
> - copy assignment: The synthesized copy assignment will be called. The outcome of this operation is identical with the copy operation.
move assignment: The synthesized move assignment will be called. The rest is the same as the move operation.
> - destroy: The synthesized destructor will be called. It will call the <u>destructor of shared_ptr which decrements the use count</u>. If the count becomes zero, the destructor from shared_ptr will delete the resources it point to.

Query_base是一个<mark>抽象基类</mark>，没有任何数据成员。
